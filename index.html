        In October 2023, the Biden Administration issued an
        <a

        to advance agencies’ efforts across the federal government, building on
        previous actions to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks of AI.
        &quot;The Executive Order
        <a
          href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/"
          >establishes</a
        >
        new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy,
        advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers,
        promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around
        the world, and more.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        One under reported aspect of the executive order requires &quot;the
        Director of [the Office of Management and Budget] shall, on an annual
        basis, issue instructions to agencies for the collection, reporting, and
        publication of agency AI use cases&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        To comply with this order, the federal government publicly shared
        &quot;Federal AI Use Case Inventory&quot; on
        <a href="ai.gov">ai.gov</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As more advanced technology becomes more prevalent in federal state and
        local government we must be aware and who these technology products hurt
        and help There are many promising and encouraging uses of machine
        learning and AI currently but a blind faith that these technologies can
        solve all inefficiently and issue in government is a mislead belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a quick aside, its worth mentioning the impact that the format of
        data can have the accessability and usability. One of the principles of
        posted by <a href="https://resources.data.gov/">resources.data.gov</a>,
        an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other
        resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use
        throughout the federal government, is that the data is
        <a href="https://resources.data.gov/PoD/principles/">accessible</a>
        meaning that open data from the government should be &quot;made
        available in convenient, modifiable, and open formats...&quot; and
        &quot;...should be made available to the widest range of users for the
        widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple
        formats for consumption.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this is rarely upheld as anyone that works with
        government data knows that you never know what format the data will be
        in. One of the most common formats are PDFs which are often easy to view
        on a computer but much more difficult to access the data to analyze and
        are not
        <a href="https://resources.data.gov/glossary/machine-readable-file/"
          >machine-readable</a
        >. On the flip side, tabular data formats like CSVs or Excel files are
        machine-readable but impossible or at the least difficult to analyze.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are governments addressing these concerns by providing
        &quot;multiple formats for consumption&quot; including machine readable
        formats as well as dashboards, charts, and maps to allow users with a
        variety of technical skills to still access and use the data. The City
        of Chicago&#39;s
        <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">Open Data Portal</a> is one
        example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking this link begins a download of a csv file. I will give them one
        point for providing a machine readable format and then promptly take a
        point away for just providing a 710 row CSV file. This format is
        essentially useless for most people. They neglect to provide any summary
        statistics or way to view the inventory in a table . As the federal
        governments own principles outline, this does feel &quot;available to
        the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.&quot;

        The use cases are reported across 21 departments and agencies. AI use is
        now widespread in government. All 15 executive departments have as least
        one report AI use case. Just two departments, the Department of Energy
        and the Department of Health and Human Services make up almost half of
        all reported use cases in the inventory. The Department of Commerce,

        What exactly is considered a "use case of AI"? The collected inventory
        shows that the federal government struggles to provide a clear
        understanding ([as many other do as
        well](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/)).
        The inventory includes use cases that range from chatbots using [Large
        Language Models](link) machine learning models using
      </div>
      <div class="scroller" id="sTechMiss">
        While the inventory included a `Technique` field, it is relatively
        useless as there are not standardized categories across departments as
        well as over half of uses cases not having a listed technique. Despite
        it being labeled as mandatory in the [provided instructions to
        agencies](), over 50% of use cases have no listed a technique. The TODO
        departments listed technique, TODO blank and blank listed not technique.
      </div>
      <div class="scroller" id="sTechSplit">
        To better understand the uses cases, I reviewed the use case listed
        technique (if provided), titles and summary information, to create mg
        own groupings. TODO Blank % of the models were this and that. See all
        the categories I created using the drop down. Find additional
        information about what each category means here. TODO
      </div>
      <div class="scroller" id="sTechSource">
        In addition to technique, only 17 use cases have publicly available
        source code.
      </div>
      <div class="scroller" id="sStageMiss">
        Also included in the use case inventory is information that indicates
        its stage in development. Once again, despite being a mandatory field in
        the [provided instruction](link) (TODO), just under 50% had not listed
        development stage.
      </div>
      <div class="scroller" id="sStageSplit">
        Of the use cases that did includes a development stage, roughly 50% are
        currently in use, a quarter are in development and a quarter are in
        planning. As expected, it appears the use of AI in the federal
        government will continue to increase considering the amount of uses in
        development or planning.

        This inventory is not only outdated at this point, but also incredibly

        While reviewing the <a href="link">guidelines</a> for the inventory,
        there appears to be lots of value information that was collected that
        was not shared in this instal release. This includes questions such as
        TODO. It appears this initial release was a collection of each of each
        department <a href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">posted page</a>. One
        may be able to get some of this information by viewing the inventory
        from each individual department&#39;s link
