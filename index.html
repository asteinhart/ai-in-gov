          href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/"
          >establishes</a
        >
        new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americansâ€™ privacy,
        advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers,
        promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around
        the world, and more."
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to creating new standards for AI safety and security, the
        executive order requires that the "the Director of [the Office of
        Management and Budget] shall, on an annual basis, issue instructions to
        agencies for the collection, reporting, and publication of agency AI use
        cases."
      </p>
      <p>
        To comply with this order, the federal government created the first ever
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/"
          >Federal AI Use Case Inventory</a
        >. As technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, this inventory
        marks an important moment in addressing the ways that that technology
        can be utilized for the public good in ways that are safe, secure, and
        transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the inventory is not without its flaws. For anyone that has
        worked with government data knows, providing data in a accessible format
        is never a given. Attempting to view the inventory simply begins a
        download of a csv file.

          id="use-case-button"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        I will give them one point for providing a
        <a

          >machine-readable</a
        >
        format and then promptly take a point away for just providing a 710 row
        CSV file. This format is essentially useless for most people. They
        neglect to provide any summary statistics or way to view the inventory
        such as in a table. As the federal government's
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/PoD/principles/"
          >own principles</a
        >
        outline, this data is not accessible and is not "available to the widest
        range of users for the widest range of purposes."

          The Federal AI Use Case Inventory contains 710

        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="sExample">
          For the inventory, each department and agency submitted their own list
          of use cases. For example, the Department of Treasury included a
          <span class="highlight ex">Collection Voice Bot</span>, an model to
          help direct a taxpayer down to a certain call path given their speech.

        <div class="scroller" id="sDep">
          The use cases are spread across 21 departments and agencies including

          What exactly is considered an "use case of AI"? The collected
          inventory shows that the federal government struggles to provide a
          clear understanding of this term, a

          >
          for most people in non technical backgrounds. In the inventory, the
          term AI is incredibly expansive. It includes use cases that fit the
          traditional definition such as machine learning models that use
          <a target="_blank" href="link">large language models</a> for
          <span class="highlight ex">chatbots</span> or
          <a target="_blank" href="link">neural networks</a> for
          <span class="highlight ex">facial recognition</span> but also includes
          <span class="highlight ex">analytics tools</span>, and
          <span class="highlight ex">data infrastructure</span>, technical tools
          that most experts would not consider AI.
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="sTechMiss">
          While the inventory includes a field for departments to list a
          technique for each use case, there are not standardized categories
          across departments. In addition, despite it being labeled as mandatory
          in the
          <a
            target="_blank"

            >provided instructions to agencies</a
          >, over 50% of use cases have
          <span class="highlight non">no listed technique</span>. 10 of the 21
          departments / agencies did not provide a technique for a single
          reported use cases including the Department of Commerce, the
          Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Veteran
          Affairs.
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="sTechSplit">
          Using the use case titles and summary, I attempted to standardize and
          fill in any missing techniques. While this is not a perfect
          categorization, it does give insight into how the federal government
          is using AI. TODO Blank % of the models were this and that. See all
          the categories I created using the drop down. TODO Click here to view
          expanded definitions of each technique.

        <div class="scroller" id="sTechSource">
          In addition to technique, just 2% of the use cases have
          <span class="highlight ex">publicly available source code</span>. This
          raises concerns about the transparency of AI tools being used by the
          federal government.
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="sStageMiss">
          Also included in the inventory is information indicating a use case's
          stage in development. Once again, despite being a mandatory field in
          the provided instruction, roughly 50% have no provided development
          stage.
        </div>
        <div class="scroller" id="sStageSplit">
          Of the use cases that did includes a development stage, roughly 50%
          are currently in use, 25% are in development and 25% are in planning.
          As expected, it appears the use of AI in the federal government will
          continue to increase considering the amount of uses in development or
          planning.

        <div class="scroller" id="sClosing">
          There is much more to explore in the Federal AI Use Case Inventory.

        While reviewing the <a target="_blank" href="link">guidelines</a> for
        the inventory, there appears to be lots of value information that was
        collected that was not shared in this instal release. This includes
        questions such as TODO. It appears this initial release was a collection
        of each of each department
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">posted page</a>.
        One may be able to get some of this information by viewing the inventory
        from each individual department&#39;s link
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ai.gov/ai-use-cases/">here</a> or this

      <p>
        As a quick aside, its worth mentioning the impact that the format of
        data can have the accessability and usability. One of the principles of
        posted by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/"
          >resources.data.gov</a
        >, an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other
        resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use
        throughout the federal government, is that the data is
        <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.data.gov/PoD/principles/"
          >accessible</a
        >
        meaning that open data from the government should be"made available in
        convenient, modifiable, and open formats..." and "...should be made
        available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes,
        often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption."
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this is rarely upheld as anyone that works with
        government data knows that you never know what format the data will be
        in. One of the most common formats are PDFs which are often easy to view
        on a computer but much more difficult to access the data to analyze and
        are not
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://resources.data.gov/glossary/machine-readable-file/"
          >machine-readable</a
        >. On the flip side, tabular data formats like CSVs or Excel files are
        machine-readable but impossible or at the least difficult to analyze.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are governments addressing these concerns by providing "multiple
        formats for consumption" including machine readable formats as well as
        dashboards, charts, and maps to allow users with a variety of technical
        skills to still access and use the data. The City of Chicago&#39;s
        <a target="_blank" href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/"
          >Open Data Portal</a
