       "243  This project will develop an ML algorithm to predict the time when a \\ngrowing fracture will reach the monitored well. The ML workflow will be \\ntrained on the distinctive tensile strain signature that precedes the \\ngrowing fracture. The new workflow will be designed to work in \\nconjunction with the fracture warning ML workflow developed in EY21. \\nTogether, these workflows will: (1) provide an early warning of well-to-\\nwell communication, (2) predict the measured depths where the \\ncommunication will happen, and (3) provide an estimated time until the \\nbeginning of well-to-well communication.  \n",
