In October 2023, the Biden Administration issued an [executive order on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) to advance agencies’ efforts across the federal government, building on previous actions to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks of AI. "The Executive Order [establishes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/) new standards for AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, stands up for consumers and workers, promotes innovation and competition, advances American leadership around the world, and more."

The executive order also states: "To improve transparency for agencies’ use of AI, the Director of OMB shall, on an annual basis, issue instructions to agencies for the collection, reporting, and publication of agency AI use cases, pursuant to section 7225(a) of the Advancing American AI Act."

To comply with this order, the federal government currently shares a Federal AI Use Case Inventory on [ai.gov](ai.gov). However to my dismay, when you click the link, it begins a download of a raw file of the data. 

In an effort to make the data more accessible
